# Access & Discovery of Documentary Images (ADDI)

## Overview

This repository holds an archive of the materials produced for the ADDI
project, which ran from May 2021 through January 2022. The project was
designed to adapt and apply computer vision algorithms to aid in the
discovery and use of digital collections, specifically documentary
photography collections held by the Library of Congress. The five collections
that were used in this study are:

- Detroit Publishing Company (25,172 photos) [[link](http://www.loc.gov/pictures/collection/det/)]
- Farm Security Administration-Office of War Information (170,907 photos) [[link](http://www.loc.gov/pictures/collection/fsa/)]
- George Grantham Bain Collection (41,447 photos) [[link](https://www.loc.gov/pictures/collection/ggbain/)]
- Harris & Ewing Collection (41,542 photos) [[link](https://www.loc.gov/pictures/collection/hec/)]
- National Photo Company (35,619 photos) [[link](https://www.loc.gov/pictures/collection/npco/)]

All of the collections have been digitized by the Library of Congress and are
listed as having "No known restrictions on publication."

## Project Elements

Each of the final elements of the project are listed in this repository in
one of the number folders. These are (1) the replication code, (2) the computed
metadata, (3) a methods paper, (4) a data analysis paper, (5) biweekly reports
submitted to the Library of Congress, (6) code for an interactive visualization
of the metadata, and (7) an archived version of the Distant Viewing Toolkit.

A working version of the visualization tool can be found through GitHub pages
at:
